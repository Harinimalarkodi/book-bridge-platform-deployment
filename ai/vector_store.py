"""
ChromaDB Vector Store - Book Bridge Library Assistant Agent
--------------------------------------------------------------
Domain: Smart Campus / College

This module is a separate, self-contained integration with ChromaDB
(a local vector database). It stores an embedding for every book in
the existing SQLite `books` table so the Library Assistant Agent can
retrieve the most relevant books for a user's question before asking
Groq to answer (Retrieval Augmented Generation / RAG).

This file does NOT touch the SQLite schema, the Flask routes, or any
existing page. It is only imported by:
- ai/groq_assistant.py    (to retrieve context before calling Groq)
- app.py                  (to keep the index in sync: sync on startup,
                            upsert when a book is added, delete when a
                            book is removed)

Storage:
ChromaDB persists its data locally to the `chroma_db/` folder inside
the project (created automatically on first use) — no external vector
database service is required.
